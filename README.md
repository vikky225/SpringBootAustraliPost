# Post code lookup service
A postcode service to show the rest api architecture with Australia postcode data.

* User can use it to create new postcode-suburb combination, same combination can't be created 
  twice. 
* Search suburb information by postcode.
* Lookup a postcode with given suburb name.
  
It uses in-memory database (H2) to preload the Australia postcodes, suburbs and states.
